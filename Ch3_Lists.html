  <h2>Chapter 3: Lists</h2>
  <br />
<!--This page shows the diffrences between when published and where HTML 5 now in March of 2016. The omitted part s of code from the book to this code are no longer standard. It is deprecated.-->
  <p>
    There are time when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Ordered lists</b> are lists where each item is numbered. A recipe, or legal contract are some examples.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Unordered lists</b> are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Definition lists</b> are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
      </li>
    </ul>
<hr />

  <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Chop potatoes into quaters
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer in salted water for 15-20 minutes until tender
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat milk, butter, and nutmeg
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain potates and mash
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in the milk mixture
      </li>
   </ol>


   <p>
     Browsers indent lists by default. <b>Sometimes</b> there will be a <b>type attribute</b> used with the <b>ol</b> element to specify the type of numbering <b>(numbers, letters, roman numerals, etc)</b>. It is better to use the CSS list-style-type property of this.
   </p>
<hr />

  <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>
        1kg King Edward potatoes
      </li>
      <li>
        100ml milk
      </li>
      <li>
        50g salted butter
      </li>
      <li>
        Freshly grated nutmeg
     </li>
     <li>
        Salt and pepper to taste
      </li>
   </ul>

   <p>
     Browsers indent lists by default.  <b>Sometimes</b> there will be a <b>type attribute</b> used with th <b>ul</b> element to specify the type of numbering <b>(circles, squares, diamonds, etc)</b>. It is better to use the CSS list-style-type property of this.
   </p>
<hr />

  <h2>Definition List</h2>

   <!--dl tag in HTML 4 = definition list. dl tag in HTML 5 = description list-->

    <dl>
      <dt>
        Sashimi
      </dt>
        <dd>
          Sliced raw fish that is served with condiments such as shredded daikon radish or ginger root, wasabi, and soy sauce
        </dd>
      <dt>
        Scale
      </dt>
        <dd>
          A device used to accurately measure the weight of ingredients
        </dd>
        <dd>
          A technique by which scales are removed from the skin of a fish
        </dd>
      <dt>
        Scamorze
      </dt>
      <dt>
        Scamorzo
      </dt>
        <dd>
          An Italian cheese usually made from whole cow's milk (although it was traditionally made from buffalo's milk)
        </dd>
    </dl>

   <p>
     The description list usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the <b>dl</b> element are pairs of <b>dt</b> and <b>dd</b> elements.
     The <b>dt element</b> contains the <b>term being defined</b>, the <b>dd element</b> contains the <b>definition</b>.

     Sometimes a list will have two terms for the same definition or two diffrent definitions for the same term.
   </p>
<hr />

  <h2>Nested Lists</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mousses
      </li>
      <li>
        Pastries
        <ul>
          <li>
            Croissant
          </li>
          <li>
            Mille-feuille
          </li>
          <li>
            Palmier
          </li>
          <li>
            Profiterole
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Tarts
      </li>
   </ul>

   <p>
     A second list can be put inside a <b>li</b> element to create a <b>sub-list</b> or <b>nested list</b>.
     </p>
     <p>
      Browsers display nested lists indented further than its parent list. In nested unordered lists, the browser will usually change to the style of the bullet point too.
    </p>

   <ol>
   <li>
   Melt butter in a fryin pan over a medium heat
   </li>
   <li>
   Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl
   </li>
   <li>
   Once butter has melted add cream and eggs
   </li>
   <li>
   Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as is you are making an omlette)

    An unordered list is used to outline the ingredients and an ordered list is used to describe the steps
